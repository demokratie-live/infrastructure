- **Full Pipeline**: `pnpm ci:full` with security scans and comprehensive validation
- **CI-Friendly**: Proper exit codes, artifact generation, and failure reporting
- **Environment Detection**: Automatic CI environment detection and configuration

### 5. **Cost Analysis & Optimization**

- **Multi-Environment Cost Tracking**: Dev, staging, and production cost estimates
- **Resource Breakdown**: Detailed cost analysis by component and resource type
- **Optimization Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions for cost reduction
- **Annual Projections**: Long-term cost planning with $1,608/year estimate

### 6. **Resource Cleanup Management**

- **Safe Cleanup Scanner**: `pnpm cleanup:scan` to identify unused resources
- **Protection Rules**: Automatic protection of critical infrastructure
- **Dry-Run Mode**: Safe preview of cleanup actions before execution
- **Cleanup Reports**: Detailed analysis of resource utilization

### 7. **Operational Documentation**

- **Enhanced OPERATIONS.md**: Comprehensive guide for all operational tasks
- **Command Reference**: Quick access to all infrastructure management commands
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and resolution procedures

## 🚀 Available Commands

### Testing & Validation

```bash
pnpm test:all                    # Run all infrastructure tests
pnpm validate:mock               # Mock validation (CI/CD safe)
pnpm validate:live               # Live stack validation
pnpm validate:deployment         # Post-deployment validation
```

### Health Monitoring

```bash
pnpm status                      # Quick infrastructure status
pnpm status:save                 # Save status report
pnpm health:check                # Health check
pnpm health:full                 # Comprehensive health check
pnpm health:dns                  # DNS-only health check
pnpm health:k8s                  # Kubernetes-only health check
```

### CI/CD Integration

```bash
pnpm ci:fast                     # Fast CI pipeline
pnpm ci:full                     # Full CI pipeline with security
```

### Cost & Resource Management

```bash
tsx scripts/cost-analyzer.ts     # Cost analysis
pnpm cleanup:scan                # Scan for unused resources
pnpm cleanup:report              # Generate cleanup report
```

### Stack Management

```bash
pnpm foundation:preview          # Preview foundation changes
pnpm foundation:up               # Deploy foundation
pnpm platform:preview            # Preview platform changes
pnpm platform:up                 # Deploy platform
```

## 📊 Current Infrastructure Status

- **💰 Total Monthly Cost**: $134 across all environments
- **🏗️ Environments**: Dev ($39), Staging ($39), Production ($56)
- **🎯 Health Status**: Degraded (5/6 components healthy)
- **🛡️ Protected Resources**: Kubernetes clusters and critical infrastructure
- **🗑️ Cleanup Candidates**: 14 resources identified for potential cleanup

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Promise Leak Resolution

- Replaced problematic StackReference usage in testing
- Implemented mock data approach for CI/CD contexts
- Maintained live validation capability within Pulumi programs

### Modular Architecture

- Separated concerns: testing, validation, monitoring, and cleanup
- Reusable components across different operational contexts
- Extensible framework for future enhancements

### Error Handling

- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Comprehensive error reporting with actionable details
- Timeout protection for all external service calls

### Security Features
